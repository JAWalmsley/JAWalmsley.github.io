			</td>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=4>
					I chose this motherboard because it has the correct socket for my CPU and because it has a lot of slots for RAM. Most motherboards only have 4 slots. This allows me to upgrade it more in the future.

				NAS Drive: A drive that is durable enough to be on 24/7 for servers and network storage.
			</td>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=4>
					I got this drive because 7200RPM is the fastest speed of mechanical drive I could find. I have this as well as an SSD because a hard drive can be useful for mass storage that doesn't need to be accessed often, such as a large amount of(entirely legal) movie downloads.

				Raytracing: A lighting method that creates tiny rays going outward from every light source, then calculating the way those rays are absorbed and bounced around. Creates very realistic lighting but difficult to do in real-time without the dedicated hardware this card has.
			</td>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=4>
					This card is easily the best card on the market at the moment. Not many games have raytracing implemented but I see that becoming more common and RTX series cards willl be necessary to get beautiful lighting. I wouldn't buy this for a personal build as it is expensive at the moment, but this is a dream PC.

				Dual Chamber: A system of organisation in cases that has one compartment with a window for everything that needs airflow: Graphics Cards, CPU, etc. Another, hidden compartment keeps everything else out of the way: Drives, Power Supply, etc. This allows more airflow to the parts that need it and also only puts the coolest-looking things on display.
			</td>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=4>
					I chose this case because the dual chamber system keeps everything that's ugly like power supply and drives away from the window, and that means I don't have to cable manage as much.

			<td colspan=4> 
				80+ Titanium: A measure of efficiency. 80+ means more than 80% efficient, then there are classes of greater than 80% efficiency. Titanium is the highest, with ~94% efficiency at 50% load.
			</td>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=4>
					This power supply is a fully modular, which means I don't need to clutter my case with cables I don't want. It is also a very high wattage. While I don't need this much power, this means the power supply will stay quiet all the time because it will only be at around 50% load.

				Dell ComfortView: A software solution that reduces blue light emissions to be easier on eyes over a long period of time.

					I chose this monitor mainly because it is 8K resolution. It's stupidly expensive but it is the highest resolution monitor that is commercially available.
